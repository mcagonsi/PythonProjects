          - The game involves two players to enter their names.
          - The game automatically generates a number between 1 to 5.
          - Each player has turn to guess the number right.
          - For each turn you have two tries; 
              * if you guess the number right on the first try you move two steps.
              * if you guess the number right after two tries you move only one step.
              * if you are not able to guess the number right after two tries you do not move.
          - The first player to reach or cross the last box/step wins the race!
          - Get racing and put your guessing skills to test!""")
