There might be some bugs in the program
***********************************************

There are certain required dependencies in the program for you to be able to run it please see the requirements text file to install them

OnlineBankApp.py is the main program that you need to run.

Before running the program you might want to setup a database. if you are using a localhost server on your machine you just need to run the
database sql scripts for each Bank Simulation Folder in the simulation test folder to create the database for each simulated bank

A demo account will be created already.

note that you have to create your own account by running the Admin.py first and add your personal account through the console interface.

After that you can proceed to test out the program proper, please take note of your chequinq account number when you open your account as you will need it to create an online banking account ;)

Note: some minor bugs;
- you have to exit the app and run the OnlineBankApp.py again after creating your account.
- ensure you set up your own transaction pin first or transaction won't authorize
- if you cancel with the sendmoney window it completely exits the program. (sorry about that but working on a fix ;) )
- to view updated transaction history after a transaction you will have exit and login again ( working on a fix), however the balance updates immediately when refreshed.

conclusion:
thanks for trying out the program do leave feedbacks!
